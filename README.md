# Your-Task
Your Task is basically like your TO-DO list which you create on your daily basis. Using Your Task, you can create your task by giving title and note of that task.

I have created this application using firebase to store all the task so that user get the task, whatever they had saved.

This application works online only means net connection is required for the functioning of this application. Because to save the task to the fire base or to retrieve the task from that, net connection is required.
